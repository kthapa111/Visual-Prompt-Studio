## Selected Artwork
Majorca Chocho: Treasure (2023) by Daniela Maria Ferreira C-V  
Medium: Porcelain, glaze, paint, and 24K gold leaf.

## AI Prompt
Create a sculptural wall-mounted artwork inspired by porcelain corn.
The piece should feature a central three-dimensional ear of corn attached to a 
white wall, with individual kernels arranged in a circular pattern radiating outward. 
Use porcelain texture with smooth surfaces and subtle shine. Add gold accents on some kernels to create emphasis and symbolism. 
The artwork should feel minimalist but symbolic, with strong negative space around it. 
Lighting should create soft shadows to emphasize depth and form.

## Reflection

In recreating this artwork, I focused on maintaining the central sculptural form and the circular arrangement of kernels.
I included porcelain texture and gold accents to reflect the symbolic meaning of value and treasure.
The recreation captures the minimalist style and use of negative space, while still emphasizing cultural and historical 
symbolism connected to corn.
